# Node.js-project
Online (ongoing) course learning about Node.js. 

Online course that has gone over how to use Node.js to set up the back end of a web application. This has involved building API’s, setting up Error Handling and using Node.js to enhance security with Authentication and Atheisation. 

I have also learned how to use MongoDB, Compass and Atlas. 

I have learned how to use Postman to test API’s before going into a live environment. 

As the project continues I will learn how to use Node.js for data modelling, payments, email and file upoads.
